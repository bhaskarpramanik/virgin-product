# Animus Platform
Animus Platform - PHP web development framework
Here we have a brand new PHP platform which aims to help the developer community build applications for the web, both big and
small quicker than conventional platforms.
The framework employes a hybrid type of routing mechanism, which automates routing for most generic tasks in the platform. The 
project is still a work in progress, but we plan to release soon, and help the developer community take over it.
